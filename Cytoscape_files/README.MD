This folder contains additional materials for the article **Extracting knowledge networks from plant scientific literature: Potato tuber flesh color as an exemplary trait**.

Here you can find two [Cytoscape](https://www.cytoscape.org) networks, as indicated in the manuscript.

Cytoscape version 3.7.1 was used, but any 3.x.x version should work.

## How to view

* The `.cys` files are Cytoscape session files. You can view them by opening them by selecting `File` > `Open...` in the application (or you can press `Ctrl+O` / `Command+O` instead).

* The `.xml` files use XGMML. They share the content of their corresponding Cytoscape session file. They can be viewed by selecting `File` > `Import` > `Network from File...` (or you can press `Ctrl+L` / `Command+L` instead).

 
## File contents

* `Full_training_set_network-cytoscape_session.cys` / `Full_training_set_network_for_cytoscape_import.xml` show the network retrieved from the 34 full-text articles we selected.


* `Full_test_set_network-cytoscape_session.cys` / `Full_test_set_network-for_cytoscape_import.xml` show the full network constructed from the 4023 PubMed abstracts selected.
